# NLP---POS-Tagging---BrillTagger
As already known, one of the biggest problems (if not the biggest one) in NLP is ambiguity. In this project i will present a solution to the problem by re-tagging POS (Parts of speech). It was done by Brill Tagger, a tagger that is trained on previous tagger, and fixes its tags.
